				Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually
				refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software
				development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop
				browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has
				become ever-increasingly important.
